vi commands
vi commands are used in "screen" mod (the default)< where you use the commands to move around the sceeen and to per form operations on the text

most vi commands follow a general pattern:
     [command][number]textobject

or the equivalent form

     [number][command]textobject

Movement commands
vi movement commands distinguish between two kinds of "words." the lowercase commmands define a word as a contig uous sequence of underscores, letters,and digits. the upper case commands define a word as a contiguous sequence of 
nonwhite space characters
